# Personal startpage
Hi! This repo hosts my personal startpage. It started being based off a tutorial but morphed into something of its own for the most part.

It features:
- Fully fluid responsive design
- Automatic theme switching based on user's device preferences
- Manual theme switching by clicking the image to the right of the links
- Pixel version of my cat via oneko.js

Pixelart clouds and Great Wave background are placeholders for whenever I get the energy to draw pretty art for this myself ^^;
